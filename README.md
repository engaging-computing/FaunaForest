# FaunaForest

## About

FaunaForest was created by Pragathi Durga Rajarajan and Adrian Cisneros as part of the the Developing AI Tools for K-12 course at the University of Texas at San Antonio, under the guidance of Dr. Fred Martin. 

FaunaForest aims to teach K-12 students about decision trees via 3 levels of interactive decision tree puzzles. Each puzzle involves completing a decision tree that has blank mystery nodes in such a way that it will correctly classify various animals. 

## Using FaunaForest 

To run FaunaForest, clone this repository and open index.html in a browser. Alternatively, the repository can be cloned and opened in Visual Sudio Code, where you can then open index.html in a browser using the 'LiveServer' extension.

## Limitations 

There is a limited number of decision tree puzzles that are predefined in the code. The number of puzzles can be increased so that students who play FaunaForest multiple times are less likely to encounter the same decision tree puzzles over and over.
